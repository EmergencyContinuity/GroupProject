Communication plan: How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?
Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.
Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? (see the git-team-workflow.md)
Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.
