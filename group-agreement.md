Communication plan: How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?
    
    Plan A communication is face to face. Meetings in the beginning and end of all coworks to ensure we're on the same page (more meetings as needed). It's anticipated most of the work will be done together as a group or in pairs to encourage efficiency and communication. 

Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
  
     We've discussed the importance of bringing up issues as they arise. Members have implied they are comfortable doing so. Emphasized that critiques are to be constructive and to keep an open mind when receiving one. 

Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.

    Group will assign tasks together and annotate on an issues page. Tentative timelines for tasks can be created by those working the task and also noted on the same issues page.

Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? (see the git-team-workflow.md)
Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.

    The group will confer together before pulls to the master branch.
